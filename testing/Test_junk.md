## About CNN article

The substance of this CNN article has been replicated in a number of other articles, mostly as a critisim of the honesty of the Trump administration in general.  I personall don't think that subscribe to this view. 

The article puports to be a "Fact Check" about a statement made by Dr. Birx during a briefing by the *President's Task Force on Coronavirus*

* The article, [Fact Check: US has done more coronavirus tests than South Korea, but not per person - CNNPolitics](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/coronavirus-testing-trump-south-korea-fact-check/index.html), states:

>Jennifer Horney, founding director of the University of Delaware's epidemiology program, told CNN that epidemiologists generally use rates only like tests per capita to make comparisons.
>
>"I think the important clarification is that **we should be considering the number of cases per 1 million population** and considering a rate of people tested and not the absolute numbers," Horney said. **"The absolute number of tests is not very meaningful."**
